# single layer perceptron 

using js i made a single layer perceptron.  a perceptron is also the most simple neural network model there is 

the code here do a guess if the inputs coordonees are above or below the diagonal (line) if the prediction is rigth then the point gets colerd as green if not the point  gets colored red.



in this first image i deseable the neural network, the percepton, make a guess without train:

you see how wrong he can predict with no ajustement:

but here i anable the train, and our preception shows much more able to predict the rigth guess, but not a 100% sure

* to visualize the data a use P5js a js library that uses canvas for draw in html,



ðŸ¤©special thanks for "the coding train" for their marvelous neural network playlist on youtube
